# password generator
Generate easy to remember and hard to crack password

Tool written in PHP in order to outsorce my password generation skills and of course make my life just a little bit easier :)

Having password made of random words makes it a bit easier to remember and very hard to crack via dictionary or brute force attack.

Usage:

index.php?len=18&words=3

len - Minimum password length. Valid values 8-50. Default 8.

words - Minumum count of words. Valid values 2-10. Default 2.

Both arguments can be ommited.
